# MobileAHK

This is my attempt at creating an Open Sourced mobile botting application for AHK.

If you're going to be using this, just remember:
* You can be banned! YOU WILL PROBABLY BE BANNED!
* This is free, your problems are NOT my priority.
* Feel like this is sketchy? Copy and paste the raw .ahk into your own file, and recreate your own .png files, won't even have to download anything from this repository!
* Join the discord, https://discord.gg/uc99pZG

# Setting Up Everything
This is fairly easy to setup for now, I'm trying to make this as much "download and play" as possible.

* Clone / Download the repository to wherever you want,
* Click on "Resize Bluestacks", this should make it 1240x720

* Click on selected script, and any options that appear
* Sit back and enjoy botting, you can see current progress on the GUI.
