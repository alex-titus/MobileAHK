# MobileAHK

This is my attempt at creating an Open Sourced mobile botting application for AHK.

If you're going to be using this, just remember:
* You can be banned! YOU WILL PROBABLY BE BANNED!
* This is free, your problems are NOT my priority.
* Feel like this is sketchy? Copy and paste the raw .ahk into your own file, and recreate your own .png files, won't even have to download anything from this repository!
* Join the discord, https://discord.gg/uc99pZG

# Setting Up Everything
# Unfortunately not working correctly as I can't resize Bluestacks correctly x)
1. Open the Settings icon on the top right, and change resolution to this: ![Set your BlueStacks up like this](https://i.imgur.com/DuTdlXX.png)
2. Set your background of your VM, PC, or whatever you're running it on as black!
	* This will ensure there are no errors in image detection
	* This isn't  100% needed, but will save some headaches for you.
3. Download Windows DebugView (Only needed for seeing easy output of what the bot is doing! https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview
